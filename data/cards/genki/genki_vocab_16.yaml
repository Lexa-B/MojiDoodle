      This one uses する instead of the common Nをかける pattern.

      The prompt expects the version that includes the “morning” kanji.

      Oversleeping can cause lateness, but they’re not the same action.
  - answer: 起きる
    toast: |-
      That means “to wake up / get up”.
      It’s the opposite situation—getting up rather than sleeping too long.

      This one is more like “um, excuse me…”.
  - answer: うーん
    toast: |-
