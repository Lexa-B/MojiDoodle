    toast: |-
      That's "brain".
      Check the right-side component: this one uses 凶 (box with an X) rather than something like 甬.
  - answer: 能

      It lacks the left-side "flesh" radical (月) that body-part kanji often have.

      That’s “meaning/purport” (うま・むね)!
      It has a different left side component than the finger/pointing kanji.
  - answer: 持
    toast: |-
      That’s “to hold” (もつ)!
