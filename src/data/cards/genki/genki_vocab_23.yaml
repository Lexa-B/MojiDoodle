      - 模
    toast: |-
      Can be mistaken due to shared parts on the right.
      This one includes the 'tree' radical plus additional elements at the top.

      This is a concrete target, while the prompt is about a perfect/ideal model or state.

  - answers:
      - 番人
    toast: |-
      That means a “guard / watchman” in a general sense.

      That refers to an “international student.”
      It uses the same first kanji, but the meaning is about studying abroad, not house-sitting.

      - 陰口を言う
    toast: |-
      That means "to speak ill of someone behind their back" too, but the nuance is "in secret" (literally "in the shadows").
      Different first kanji: 陰 (shade) vs the one meaning "bad."
  - answers:
      - 文句を言う
    toast: |-
      That's "to complain" or "to grumble".
      It’s about expressing dissatisfaction, not specifically talking about someone behind their back.
  - answers:
      - 悪口を言わない
    toast: |-
      That’s the negative form ("don’t say bad things").
      The prompt is the plain dictionary form, not a negative command.
